# ZMK Configurations
My personal keymaps for corne keyboard which use zmk as its firmware.


## To Do
- [ ] Map mouse buttons.
- [x] Fix Home Row mods.
- [ ] Turn on the RGB if on System Layer for indication.
- [ ] Tap and hold behavior for keys like backspace and space and del if possible.
- [ ] Place brightness and volume controls and some layer.
