# ZMK Configurations
My personal keymaps for corne keyboard which use ZMK as its firmware.


## Will my keymaps work for you?
Well, I don't know. I am listing down my background, needs and preference so if you find them similar to yours then it might be helpful.

- I use Linux (distro doesn't matter really). Point being, I use several tools (e.g. Tmux, Window Manager) which are driven by key combos/shortcuts, than a normal Window user.
- I am a (soy) developer, focused on "web" side of things. So, inefficient symbol layout is a huge NO NO.
- I am a (Neo)Vim user, means that the Escape and the SPACE (leader) keys become important to me. __Although, it doesn't matter much to be honest__.
- I also use Dvorak, with English being my only requirement. Now if use QWERTY then you have to make ONLY A FEW changes that mostly involve symbols.
- I am a minimalistic person, I don't have _any_ custom made super macros, combos to run some advance fancy gadget. __Yeah, you can call me poor if you wish__.


## Features
- 6 layers configuration (Alphabets, Numbers, Symbols, Navigations, Function Keys and System (ZMK) Keys).
- Focused on introducing minimal changes (of keymaps) without much compromise so that one can switch back to normal keyboard (due to whatever reasons) without much hassle.
- Focused on mapping the keys suitable for developer (that involves symbols, tons of key combos for shortcuts etc).
- NO HOME ROW keys (I find them problematic so have put this as a feature).
- As far as I remember, nothing complex, zmk exclusive is used in any of the layout (apart from SYSTEM layer, of course). So should you need to use QMK in future, you may find it very easy to port.  


## Tips
- Try any layout for few days at the very least. Sometimes, it's not the incorrect key placement but your phase to adapt to the new change.


## Shortcomings
- Due to fewer number of keys available, many of the usual combos that required 2 keys, now are 3 keys combo (in a way).
- It's not perfect yet. Only those mappings have been planned which I needed *now* and not which I __might__ need tomorrow. 


## Was split, ortholinear keyboard (not specifically to Corne, I believe) worth the pain?
YES! And for me, by a far margin.


## To Do
- [ ] Map mouse buttons.
- [ ] Turn on the RGB if on System Layer for indication, if possible.
- [x] Tap and hold behavior for keys like backspace, space and delete if possible.
